# Hollow Line

Hollow Line is a command line survival tale set in a long-sealed metro system where time has stopped moving. You wake in the dark among rust, dust and cold concrete, with no memory of how you arrived. The corridors stretch into quiet places where water drips from broken pipes and distant echoes roll through empty tracks.

Your only way out is through a handful of forgotten rooms scattered across the ruins. A lantern hides in one place, a metal hook in another and a locked hatch waits deep in the dark. Somewhere along the service route a shape wanders in slow, patient cycles. It does not chase, yet crossing its path too often invites danger that grows by degrees.

Every step forward shifts something in the dark. The tracks hum with distant tension, metal sighs behind the walls and the old air moves as if stirred by unseen currents. The deeper you go, the more the place feels aware of you, as if it has been waiting for someone to walk these paths again.

You must decide when to press on and when to pause, when to risk a corridor and when to turn back. Light helps, tools matter and attention keeps you alive. Nothing in these tunnels is loud, nothing is hurried, yet mistakes build quietly until they become final.

Reach the hatch. Bring what the place offers. Leave before the dark remembers your shape too clearly.
